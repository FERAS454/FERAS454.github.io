Welcome to my blog!

I'm Feras, a Senior Incident Response and Threat Hunting Analyst with expertise in forensics, detection engineering, and cybersecurity defense. I specialize in advanced threat detection and response, focusing on protecting critical infrastructures. This blog provides technical insights and practical knowledge to help strengthen defenses.

I’m passionate about not only identifying and responding to threats but also diving deep into advanced detection engineering.
